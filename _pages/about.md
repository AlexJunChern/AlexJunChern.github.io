I am an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics at China Agricultural University, and I am expected to graduate in 2026. My research interest includes Political Economy, Development Economics and Industrial Organization. 

The research I am conducting is about the green transformation of China's auto market, and technological innovation and development of artificial intelligence. 

I believe that ideas are the true forces that govern the world, and the study of economics holds the power to reduce global inequality.
