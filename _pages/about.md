I am an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics at China Agricultural University, and I am expected to graduate in 2026. My research interest includes Political Economy, Development Economics and Industrial Organization. 

The research I am conducting focuses on the green transformation of China’s automotive market, as well as technological innovation and the development of artificial intelligence. I am open to collaborating with researchers from all areas of economics and welcome discussions on related topics. Feel free to reach out to me at AlexanderJunChern@foxmail.com.

I believe, as Keynes observed, that “the ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood.” These ideas are the true forces that rule our world. Economics should serve as a tool to understand our world and to reduce pervasive inequalities.
